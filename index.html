    <h1>What is PHP?</h1>
    <h2>PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor.</h2>
    <p>It is a server-side scripting language embedded in HTML.</p>
    <p>PHP code is executed on the server, and the result is sent to the client's browser as plain HTML.</p>
    
    <h2>Syntax:</h2>
    <p>PHP code is enclosed in <code>&lt;?php</code> and <code>?&gt;</code> tags.</p>
    <p>Statements end with a semicolon (<code>;</code>).</p>

    <h1>PHP Features</h1>

    <h2>Server-Side Scripting:</h2>
    <p>PHP is executed on the server side. This means the PHP code is processed on the web server, and only the output (usually HTML) is sent to the client's browser. This is in contrast to client-side languages like JavaScript, which are executed in the user's browser.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Platform Compatibility:</h2>
    <p>PHP runs on various platforms, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and Unix. It is compatible with almost all servers used today, making it a versatile choice for web development.</p>

    <h2>Open Source:</h2>
    <p>PHP is an open-source language, which means it's free to use and distribute. Its open nature has led to a large and active community that contributes to its development and provides extensive support.</p>

    <h2>Integration Capabilities:</h2>
    <p>PHP can be easily integrated with other technologies, such as web servers (Apache, Nginx), databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite), and different protocols (HTTP, LDAP, IMAP), allowing for seamless interaction with various components of a web application.</p>

    <h2>Template Engine:</h2>
    <p>PHP can be used as a template engine. Template engines allow developers to separate the logic (PHP code) from the presentation (HTML/CSS), promoting better code organization and maintainability.</p>

    <h2>Dynamic Web Content:</h2>
    <p>PHP enables the creation of dynamic web content. It can generate dynamic page content, create, read, write, delete, and close files on the server, collect form data, send and receive cookies, and modify database data.</p>

    <h2>Community Support:</h2>
    <p>PHP has a vast and active community. Numerous online forums, blogs, and tutorials are available, making it easier for developers to find solutions to problems, learn new techniques, and stay updated with the latest trends in PHP development.</p>

    <h2>Rapid Development:</h2>
    <p>PHP allows for rapid development of web applications due to its simplicity and ease of use. It offers a wide range of functions and features, reducing the need for writing extensive code from scratch.</p>

    <h2>Security Features:</h2>
    <p>PHP provides built-in security features such as data validation and sanitization functions, secure session management, and protection against common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.</p>

    <h2>Content Management Systems (CMS):</h2>
    <p>Many popular CMS platforms, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, are built using PHP. These CMS systems provide a user-friendly interface for managing website content, making PHP a go-to choice for creating dynamic and interactive websites without extensive coding knowledge.</p>
